# From-Nand-To-Tetris
Welcome to the repository for projects developed within the 'From Nand to Tetris' course, crafted by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. This course is designed to guide participants through the process of constructing a modern computer from fundamental principles. Below is a succinct overview of the essential projects:

**Boolean Logic (Project 1):**
Build fundamental logic gates, laying the groundwork for constructing the computer in this course.

**Boolean Arithmetic (Project 2):**
Emphasize the creation of a set of chips, ultimately leading to the development of the Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU), a vital component of the CPU.

**Sequential Logic (Project 3):**
Gradually assemble a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit, addressing challenges related to persistent bit storage and memory register operations.

**Machine Language (Project 4):**
Compose low-level assembly programs, gaining insight into the assembly process and developing an appreciation for how native binary code executes.

**Computer Architecture (Project 5):**
Define a simple machine language, construct a CPU capable of executing instructions in this language, and integrate previously developed chips into a unified architecture.

**Assembler (Project 6):**
Specify an assembler that translates assembly code into binary CPU instructions.

**Virtual Machine (Arithmetic) (Project 7):**
Explore the benefits of a stack-based virtual machine (VM) and develop its implementation. This stack-oriented VM will serve as the backend for our compiler, with a focus on stack arithmetic. Project 8 will extend this by addressing the procedure call stack.

**Virtual Machine, Continued (Control) (Project 8):**
Extend the virtual machine abstraction to handle nested subroutine calls in procedural or object-oriented languages.

**Compilation (Project 10):**
Define a Jack compiler to translate Jack classes into VM code, emphasizing syntax analysis and semantics.

**Compilation, Continued (Code Generation) (Project 11):**
Construct a fully operational compiler for the Jack language, building upon the work from the previous project.

**Operating System (Project 12):**
Examine the necessity for an operating system (OS), specify an OS API including math functions, string processing, input/output, and memory management, and implement the OS in Jack.
